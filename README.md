# office-productivity-snippets
Pyhton snippets for knowledge work productivity. Mostly vibe coded when I needed them.

## 2025-06-27
Added three standalone Python scripts written for quick office productivity tasks:
* images_to_pptx.py: Convert a folder of images into a PowerPoint deck (16:9 layout).
* pdf_to_png_nomadmin.py: Convert multi-page PDFs to PNGs.
* extract_pages.py: Extract pages from a multi page PNG into separate pngs (to address OSX Preview pdf export behaviour where it exports multipage PDFs into multipage PNGs instead of separate ones).
