## ‚úÖ What You Need

- A Mac (macOS)
- Basic Terminal use
- Python¬†3 (built into most Macs)
- A one‚Äëtime install of a few small tools (see below)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è One‚ÄëTime Setup

In Terminal, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip3 install pillow python-pptx pymupdf beautifulsoup4 markdownify python-docx
```

If `pip3` isn't found, install it first with:

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```

Then rerun the install command.

## üì¶ What Each Script Does

### `docx2md.py`

Converts a folder of **`.doc` / `.docx` Word files** to Markdown:

- **True `.docx`** files ‚Üí Markdown via `python-docx`.
- **Confluence ‚ÄúWord‚Äù exports** (MIME‚Äëwrapped HTML) ‚Üí Markdown after HTML extraction.
- **Legacy binary `.doc`** files are detected and skipped with a clear error.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 docx2md.py <input_folder_with_docs> [output_folder]
```

If `output_folder` is omitted, Markdown files are created beside the originals.

---

### `images_to_pptx.py`

Turns a folder of images into a PowerPoint presentation, with each image on its own slide and the filename as a title.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 images_to_pptx.py <image_folder> <output_file.pptx>
```

---

### `pdf_to_png_nomadmin.py`

Converts a PDF into separate PNG image files ‚Äî one per page. No special permissions or admin installs required.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 pdf_to_png_nomadmin.py <pdf_file.pdf>
```

---

### `extract_pages.py`

Takes a multi‚Äëpage image file and splits it into separate PNG files (e.g. `page_0.png`, `page_1.png`, etc).

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 extract_pages.py <input_file.png>
```

---

### `clean_html.py`

Cleans an HTML file or fragment by removing:

- Inline SVGs  
- All classes and IDs  
- `aria-*` attributes  
- `style` attributes  
- (And more clutter)

Great for preparing HTML for documentation or Markdown conversion.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 clean_html.py <input_file.html> <output_file.html>
```

---

### `html2md.py`

Converts an HTML list or fragment into a clean, readable Markdown list. Ideal for moving web‚Äëbased outlines or lists into Markdown docs.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 html2md.py <input_file.html> <output_file.md>
```
