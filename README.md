# üß∞ Mac-Friendly Office Tools (Python)

These are lightweight Python scripts built for common office tasks ‚Äî like turning images into slides, converting PDFs, cleaning up HTML, or splitting multi-page image files. No coding experience needed. If you're a designer, executive assistant, or just someone who works with documents a lot, you're in the right place.

## ‚úÖ What You Need

- A Mac (macOS)
- Basic Terminal use
- Python 3 (built into most Macs)
- A one-time install of a few small tools (see below)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è One-Time Setup

In Terminal, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip3 install pillow python-pptx pymupdf beautifulsoup4 markdownify
```

If `pip3` isn't found, install it first with:

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```

Then rerun the install command.

## üì¶ What Each Script Does

### `images_to_pptx.py`

Turns a folder of images into a PowerPoint presentation, with each image on its own slide and the filename as a title.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 images_to_pptx.py <image_folder> <output_file.pptx>
```

---

### `pdf_to_png_nomadmin.py`

Converts a PDF into separate PNG image files ‚Äî one per page. No special permissions or admin installs required.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 pdf_to_png_nomadmin.py <pdf_file.pdf>
```

---

### `extract_pages.py`

Takes a multi-page image file and splits it into separate PNG files (e.g. page_0.png, page_1.png, etc).

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 extract_pages.py <input_file.png>
```

---

### `clean_html.py`

Cleans an HTML file or fragment by removing:
- Inline SVGs
- All classes and ids
- aria-* attributes
- style attributes
- (And more clutter)

Great for preparing HTML for documentation or markdown conversion.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 clean_html.py <input_file.html> <output_file.html>
```

---

### `html2md.py`

Converts an HTML list or fragment into a clean, readable markdown list. Ideal for moving web-based outlines or lists into markdown docs.

**Usage in Terminal:**

```bash
python3 html2md.py <input_file.html> <output_file.md>
```
